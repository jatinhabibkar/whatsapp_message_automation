* This project was developed for a specific use case: gathering data from Google Sheets and broadcasting unique messages to clients.
* By understanding the client requirements and developing a cost-effective solution, this project helped a small company send a large number of messages to users with their consent.
* Using Selenium and the GCP API, we can fetch data, format user-specific messages in bulk, and forward them at a scheduled time.
* This kind of messaging system significantly boosted the company's sales
